# Unsupervised Learning With K-means
Identifying digits in the MNIST dataset using Unsupervised Learning with K-means, Autoencoding, and PCA; and Denoising on the MNIST dataset

This project includes experiments showing that classification using K-means on Principal Component Analysis-reduced encodings performs better than K-means on encodings alone. 

A second experiment shows the effectiveness of denoising using an Autoencoder.
